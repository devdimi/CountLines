The goal of the project is to track lines of code.

It is of course very important to note that more lines of code does not mean more features or better quality.
Still it is interesting for developers to know and see how many lines of code they have written.

This is a developer tool and it detects:
-Empty Lines (needed for formatting)
-Comment lines ( needed for clarification and also required by some tools)

Further ideas:
-save the lines of code in sqlite database
-Provide web report ( or app ) with progress - how lines of code have changed during month/sprint
